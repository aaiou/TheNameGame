LYRICS
------------------
Come on everybody!

I say now let's play a game

I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name

The first letter of the name, I treat it like it wasn't there

But a "B" or an "F" or an "M" will appear

And then I say "bo", add a "B", then I say the name

and "Bonana fanna" and a "fo"

And then I say the name again with an "F" very plain

and a "fee fy" and a "mo"

And then I say the name again with an "M" this time

and there isn't any name that I can't rhyme

But if the first two letters are ever the same,

I drop them both and say the name like

Bob, Bob drop the B's "Bo-ob"

For Fred, Fred drop the F's "Fo-red"

For Mary, Mary drop the M's Mo-ary

That's the only rule that is contrary.
